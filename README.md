# CyptoCurrencyPredictor
This repo makes use of the state-of-art Deep Learning algorithm to predict the price of Bitcoin, which has the potential to generalize to other cryptocurrency. It leverages models such as CNN and RNN implemented by [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) running on top of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
